/**
 * Contains an interface and implementation for a generic tree.
 * A generic tree mirrors a tree, but allows for generic values 
 * at each node rather than simply integers. Generic trees can be
 * interacted with using the values contained in the tree, the
 * integer IDs for these values, or a combination of both.
 * 
 * The GenericTree interface extends Tree so all generic trees 
 * can be used tree edit distance algorithms designed for trees.
